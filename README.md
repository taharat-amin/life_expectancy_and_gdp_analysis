## Introduction

Understanding the relationship between a country's economic performance, as measured by GDP, and the health outcomes of its citizens, as measured by life expectancy, is crucial for policymakers and researchers. This analysis aims to explore this relationship using publicly available data and statistical techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains information about GDP and life expectancy for six countries over a period of 16 years (2000-2015). The countries included in the dataset are Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, USA, and Zimbabwe. The data is obtained from [source name or link].

## Analysis Overview

The analysis follows a structured approach:

1. **Data Import and Preparation**: The dataset is loaded and preprocessed to ensure consistency and ease of analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Summary statistics are calculated, and the data is visualized to gain insights into the trends and patterns.
3. **Visualization**: Various visualizations, including bar plots and scatter plots, are created to visualize the relationship between GDP and life expectancy.
4. **Interpretation**: The findings are interpreted, and conclusions are drawn based on the analysis.

## Code Structure

The code is organized into the following sections:

1. **Importing Libraries**: Necessary libraries are imported for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.
2. **Exploring the Data**: Data is loaded, explored, and summarized to understand its structure and content.
3. **Visualizing the Data**: Visualizations are created to explore the trends and relationships within the dataset.
4. **Conclusion**: Final conclusions drawn from the analysis are provided.

## Instructions

To run the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script containing the analysis code.
4. View the results and visualizations generated by the code.

## Results

The analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between GDP and life expectancy across all countries studied. Higher GDP is associated with higher life expectancy, indicating a link between economic development and public health outcomes.
